  "Dante": "Dante Alighieri was born in Florence in May 1265, to Dona Bella and Aldighiero Alighieri. From a noble and affluent family, he devoted himself early to his studies, and the celebrated Brunetto Latini was one of his masters. He studied letters and sciences, not neglecting drawing and music. He later applied himself to theology as well.",
  "Intro": "Dante's poetic work attaches, at its most part, to his purely spiritual love for Beatriz de Folco Portinari. Dante met Beatriz when he was nine and Beatriz eight. He returned to see her after nine years, and later a few other times, for Beatrice married, and died in 1290. Although Dante also married Gemma Donati in 1291 and had several children with her, love for Beatriz constantly inspired her poetry. Most of the songs, sonnets and ballads that constitute the Canzoniere are dedicated to his beloved; New Life is a story of his love for Beatrice; the Divine Comedy, the sublime poem that perhaps humanity will never see surpassed, is also related to his love for Beatriz, as well as the desire to avenge his enemies and to expose his political ideas."
